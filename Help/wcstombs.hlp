  Name:  wcstombs
  
  #include <stdlib.h>
  size_t wcstombs(char *out, const wchar_t *in, size_t size);

  The wcstombs( ) function converts the wide-character array 
  pointed to by in into its multibyte equivalent and puts the 
  result in the array pointed to by out. Only the first size bytes
  of in are converted. Conversion stops before that if the null 
  terminator is encountered.
