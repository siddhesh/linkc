  Name:  realloc
 
  #include <stdlib.h>
  void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
  
  If ptr is null, realloc( ) simply allocates size bytes of memory 
  and returns a pointer to it. If size is zero, the memory pointed
  to by ptr is freed.If there is not enough free memory in the heap
  to allocate size bytes, a null pointer is returned, and the 
  original block is left unchanged.
