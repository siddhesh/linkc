  Name:  qsort
  
  #include <stdlib.h>
  void qsort(void *buf, size_t num, size_t size,
             int (*compare) (const void *, const void *));

  The qsort( ) function sorts the array pointed to by buf using a 
  Quicksort (developed by C. A. R.Hoare). Quicksort is generally 
  considered the best general-purpose sorting algorithm. The number
  of elements in the array is specified by num, and the size 
  (in bytes) of each element is described by size.
