  Name:  fflush

  #include <stdio.h>
  int fflush(FILE *stream);
  
  If stream is associated with a file opened for writing, 
  a call to fflush( ) causes the contents of the output buffer 
  to be physically written to the file.The file remains open.
  
  Example: 
  for(i=0; i<MAX; i++) 
  {
    fwrite(buf, sizeof(some_type), 1, fp);
    fflush(fp);
   }
