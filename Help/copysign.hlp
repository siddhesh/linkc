  #include <math.h>
  float copysignf(float val, float signval);
  double copysign(double val, double signval);
  long double copysignl(long double val, long double signval);

  The copysign( ) family of functions gives val the same sign as
  the value passed in signval, and return the result. Thus, the 
  value returned has a magnitude equal to val, but with the same 
  sign as that of signval .
