  Name:  system
  
  #include <stdlib.h>
  int system(const char *str);
  
  The system( ) function passes the string pointed to by str as a 
  command to the command processor of the operating system. If 
  system( ) is called with a null pointer, it will return nonzero 
  if a command processor is present; otherwise, it will return zero.
  
  Example:
  #include <stdlib.h>
  int main(void)
  {
     return system(''dir");
  }
