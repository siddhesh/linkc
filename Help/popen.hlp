  Name:  popen
  
  #include <stdio.h>
  FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *type);
  
  The  popen()  function  opens  a process by creating a pipe, 
  forking, and invoking the shell.  Since a pipe is by 
  definition unidirectional, the type argument may specify only
  reading or writing, not both; the resulting stream is 
  correspondingly read-only or write-only.
