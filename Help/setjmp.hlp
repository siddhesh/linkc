  Name:  setjmp
  
  #include <setjmp.h>
  int setjmp(jmp_buf envbuf);
  
  The setjmp( ) macro saves the contents of the system stack in the 
  buffer envbuf for later use by longjmp( ).It uses the header 
  <setjmp.h>.The setjmp( ) macro returns zero upon invocation. 
  However, longjmp( ) passes an argument to setjmp( ), and it is 
  this value (always nonzero) that will appear to be the value of 
  setjmp( ) after a call to longjmp( ) has occurred.
